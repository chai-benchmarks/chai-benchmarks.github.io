  <h2>Overview</h2>

  Chai is a benchmark suite of Collaborative Heterogeneous Applications for Integrated-architectures.
  The Chai benchmarks are designed to use the latest features of heterogeneous architectures such as shared virtual memory and system-wide atomics to achieve efficient simultaneous collaboration between host and accelerator devices.

  Each benchmark has multiple implementations.
  The OpenCL 2.0 and OpenCL 1.2 implementations have been released.
  The CUDA 7.5, CUDA 8.0, and C++AMP implementations and underway.

  Check out our [Getting Started](gettingstarted) page for instructions on how download and use the benchmarks.
