  <h2>Overview</h2>

  Chai is a benchmark suite of Collaborative Heterogeneous Applications for Integrated-architectures.
  The Chai benchmarks are designed to use the latest features of heterogeneous architectures such as shared virtual memory and system-wide atomics to achieve efficient simultaneous collaboration between host and accelerator devices.

  Each benchmark has multiple implementations.
  The OpenCL 2.0 and OpenCL 1.2 implementations have been released.
  The CUDA, CUDA-Sim, and C++AMP implementations are underway.
  If you would like early access to premature versions, please contact us.

  Check out our [Getting Started](gettingstarted) page for instructions on how to download and use the benchmarks.
